A take on google chrome extension :)

## simple-extension
Laying out a basic structure
[X] manifest.json
[X] alert.js
[X] popup.html
[X] popup.js
[X] content.js
[X] background.js
[X] jquery.min.js

## Thoughts to ponder on
[ ] Simple To Do list for one day in New Tab
[ ] Detailed To Do list in Pop Up from Extension
[ ] Minimalized reader for chrome with brightness, BG color and font(color and size) settings
[ ] On Selection Translate non English words
[ ] When more than X tabs are opened, get URL of all the non active tabs and open a new tab with all the links in it
[ ] To immediately hide and restore certain tabs on a key pressed
[ ] Keep track of where I have been for how long
[ ] Fancier history for Chrome with horizontal and vertical bars, timeline and charts 
[ ] When not active more than X mins make the tab sleep
[ ] To compress data when loading a webpage
[ ] Chart the history of price from various sites for a particular product listed in Amazon or similar sites
